### What I learned

This website is an exercise from the "Web Development Bootcamp" on Udemy.

For the first section, the title, i used the property "z-index" for the image for desktop and then,to create a responsive layout, I decided to use Bootstrap for the first time and his grid system.
Other elements from bootstrap I've used are the carousel, the navbar and the cards.

I've learned to be clean when I writing code and also to grow a project step by step.
